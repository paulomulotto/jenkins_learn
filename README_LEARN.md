# Jenkins: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction to Jenkins
Jenkins is a open-source automation server extensively used in software development for implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Its flexibility and vast plugin ecosystem make it an important tool for automating a wide range of development tasks.


### Understand it with a history
Imagine that you are working in a project with 5 developers. All developers are writing code.

This project has automated tests, which is good. The problem is that the deploy process is manual so the developers need to remember to run the tests and deploy the new version manually.

In this situation, we have several problems:
- A new version with a bug that could be identified with the automated tests, but the developer forgot to run it;
- Deploy new versions manually is complex and time consuming;
- Someone can update a bug fix and forgot to update it in the SCM (git) system, so the next update the bug fix can be erased.
- It will be hard for new members deploy it;
- As the deploy process is manual, is hard to track the real changes
- It is hard to monitor the process and identify bottlenecks

So, how can we solve all those problems? One way is creating a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.

*Note that it is also possible solve it using other tools, like GitHub Actions and CircleCI.*



## Core Concepts
### Jobs
- Overview: Jobs are the heart of Jenkins' functionality, designed to automate tasks.
- Types of Jobs:
    - Freestyle Project: Most common type, offering significant control.
    - Pipeline: Facilitates multi-stage projects (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy) using a Jenkinsfile. Supports Pipeline as Code (PaC).

### Nodes and Agents
- Nodes: These are the machines where tasks are executed.
- Agents: Agents handle task execution on the nodes. It's important to install necessary build tools (like Python, Java) on these nodes.

### Triggers
Types: Triggers can be push-based (like a Git commit), pull-based (like a scheduled build), or manual.

### Plugins
Utility: With Jenkins' popularity, a vast array of plugins are available, offering extended functionalities. Using these plugins is recommended over building custom solutions from scratch.

### Build
Definition: A build is an instance of a job executing specific tasks such as compiling code, running tests, or deploying applications.

## Advanced Jenkins Features

- Distributed Builds: Manage builds across multiple machines.
- Notifications: Set up notifications for build statuses.
- Folders and Parameters: Organize jobs and customize builds.
- Promotions: Define criteria for promoting builds in the pipeline.

## Best Practices in Jenkins

- Keep your Jenkins environment updated.
- Regularly review and update plugins.
- Use Pipeline as Code for versioning and collaboration.
- Monitor and optimize your Jenkins for performance.
